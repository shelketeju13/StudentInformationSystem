# StudentInformationSystem

## Project Overview
The Student Information System is a console-based Java application developed as part of an internship task.  
The application helps manage student records by allowing users to add, view, search, update, and delete student information using a menu-driven interface.

This project demonstrates core Java programming concepts, object-oriented design, and basic data handling using collections.

## Objectives
- Understand Java programming fundamentals  
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts  
- Implement a menu-driven console application  
- Practice data storage using ArrayList  
- Perform input validation and formatted output  

---

## Features
- Add student details  
- View all students in formatted output  
- Search student by student ID  
- Update existing student records  
- Delete student records  
- Input validation for age and grade  
- User-friendly menu-driven interface
